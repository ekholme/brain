[Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai?hl=en) is [[Google Cloud (GCP)|Google Cloud's]] AI and ML platform. It provides a set of tools for building, deploying, and scaling ML models. Although the tools in Vertex AI use [[Google Gemini]] models, they also provide infrastructure and [[MLOps]] capabilities.

If Google Gemini is the engine, then Vertex AI is a workshop where developers can put this engine into different kinds of cars.

## Tools and Features

Some of the tools and features offered in Vertex AI include:

- **[Vertex AI Workbench](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/introduction)**: A managed development environment for data scientists and ML engineers
- **[Vertex AI Training](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/training/overview)**: Supports training custom ML models using your own data
- **[Vertex AI Prediction](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/overview)**: Supports deploying trained models for online or batch predictions
- **[Vertex AI Pipelines](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/pipelines/introduction)**: A service for building and orchestrating ML workflows
- **[Vertex AI Model Registry](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/model-registry/introduction)**: a centralized repository for storing and managing trained models. This provides versioning and metadata tracking. This is similar I guess to Artifact Registry.
- **[Vertex AI Model Garden](https://cloud.google.com/model-garden?hl=en)**: A Google-curated selection of the best models. Note that this includes models created by Google, other companies, and open-source models.
