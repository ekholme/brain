[Python](https://www.python.org/) is an interpreted, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. Python code is easy to read, which makes it an approachable language for many people.

Python is one of the most popular languages for data science, and many of the most popular machine learning (e.g. scikit-learn) and [[Deep Learning Overview|deep learning]] frameworks (e.g. [[Pytorch]], Tensorflow) have python interfaces.

Because it is interpreted, native python is fairly slow. However, python can be translated and compiled into C or C++ code via Cython. Many python libraries that require speed are actually written in C++ or other low-level languages.
