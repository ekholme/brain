 The [Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT)](http://mixedmethodsappraisaltoolpublic.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/127916259/MMAT_2018_criteria-manual_2018-08-01_ENG.pdf) is a framework to help research users evaluate the quality of qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods studies. It's a fairly coarse tool, but it still provides a useful framework for thinking about the quality of various research studies.
