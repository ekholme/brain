[Go](https://go.dev/) is a programming language developed by Google. It's statically-typed and emphasizes simplicity and explicitness in code. It's a general-purpose programming language, and it's often used for web development projects. One of its big selling points is its concurrency system.

Unlike languages like Python and Javascript, Go (and the Go community) emphasizes doing as much as possible with the standard library, and only pulling in external packages when necessary. As a result, web applications built in Go tend not use rely on big frameworks like Django, React, etc.

I really like Go, but it's not a great language for data science tasks, so I don't get to use it for work projects all that often.
