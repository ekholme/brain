Minimalist training is an approach to working out that emphasizes efficiency. The general idea is to get a very good workout in in a relatively short amount of time. One thing to keep in mind here is that these workouts optimize for efficiency, and they won't yield optimal hypertrophy, strength, or cardio results.
## Principles
- ditch lifts that require long warmups
- ditch lifts that require lots of setup/teardown
- use as many compounds as possible
- low reps-in-reserve (RIR)
- supersets, particularly antagonistic supersets
- dropsets (go close to failure on a set, reduce the weight, then immediately go close to failure with the reduced weight)

## KB Workout Design
a solid workout could be something like:

**AMRAP 20**
- lower body push
- lower body pull
- upper body push
- upper body pull

*example*
- 15 goblet squat
- 15 kb swings
- 10 kb pushup
- 20 gorilla row

another variation of a full-body KB workout is a tabata-style with 2 circuits. Each circuit could have 3 exercises, 45s on/15s off, and you do each circuit for 4 rounds. This means you can get through the whole workout in ~25 mins. An example is:

**Circuit 1**
- KB swing
- Goblet squat
- Gorilla row

**Circuit 2**
- KB overhead press
- KB RDL
- KB pushup
