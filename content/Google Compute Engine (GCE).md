[Google Compute Engine (GCE)](https://cloud.google.com/products/compute) is a service from [[Google Cloud (GCP)]] that allows users to create and run virtual machines (VMs) on Google Cloud.

VMs can range in size and what they are optimized for. See [this table crosswalking VM types with various workloads](https://cloud.google.com/products/compute#choose-the-right-vm-for-your-workload-and-requirements) When creating toy applications, I've used the [e2](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/general-purpose-machines#e2_machine_types) machine types.
