[Julia](https://julialang.org/) is a high-performance programming language designed for math and scientific computing. It's a general purpose language and can do lots of different things, but it's mostly used for big math stuff.

I tend to like the ergonomics of Julia for the most part, especially if I'm working with matrices, distributions, and [[Bayesian statistics]]. Julia allows you to write unicode, which makes writing equations easier.
