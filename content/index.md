This is [my](https://ericekholm.com) second brain, where I keep notes on all sorts of topics, including programming, statistics, fitness, and other things I find interesting.

Probably the best way to navigate is to just search for content, but here are a few notes I've been thinking about recently:

## Fitness
-  [[Kettlebell Complexes]]
- [[Armor Building Formula]]

## Stats
- [[Maximum Likelihood Estimation]]
- [[Gradient Descent]]
- [[Bayesian statistics]]

## Technology
- [[FlexCreek Running Notes]]
- [[Python Package Development]]
- [[Julia Packages and Environments]]
