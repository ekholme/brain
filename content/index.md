This is [my](https://ericekholm.com) second brain, where I keep notes on all sorts of topics, including programming, statistics, fitness, and other things I find interesting.

Probably the best way to navigate is to just search for content, but here are a few notes I've been thinking about recently:

## AI
- [[Google Gen AI Course]]: contains links to notes central to AI and LLMs
## Baking
- [[Basic Sourdough Bread Recipe]]
- [[Lemon Blueberry Sourdough Loaf]]
- [[Toll House Bars]]
## Fitness
- [[Kettlebell Complexes]]
- [[Armor Building Formula]]
## Stats/ML
- [[Maximum Likelihood Estimation]]
- [[Gradient Descent]]
- [[Loss Functions]]
- [[Splines]]
- [[Machine Learning Model Building]]
## Technology/Coding
- [[FlexCreek Running Notes]]
- [[Go Interfaces]]
- [[Julia Packages and Environments]]
- [[Python main function]]
