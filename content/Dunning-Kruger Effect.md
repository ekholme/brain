The [Dunning-Kruger Effect] is a cognitive bias in which people with low ability in a specific area tend to overestimate their ability in that area. Inversely, people with a very high ability in a specific area tend to underestimate their ability.

This is a systematic bias that has been demonstrated across a range of fields, including business, medicine, driving, and literacy, among others.
