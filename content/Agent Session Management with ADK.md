This note contains an example of how to manage [[Context Engineering#Sessions|sessions]] with [[Google Agent Developer Kit]] (ADK) in [[Python]]. It pulls heavily from [this Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ekholme/day-3a-agent-sessions/edit)

## Setup

First, we import libraries.

```python
from typing import Any, Dict

from google.adk.agents import Agent, LlmAgent
from google.adk.apps.app import App, EventsCompactionConfig
from google.adk.models.google_llm import Gemini
from google.adk.sessions import DatabaseSessionService
from google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService
from google.adk.runners import Runner
from google.adk.tools.tool_context import ToolContext
from google.genai import types
```

Then we define a helper function to run a session:

```python
# Define helper functions that will be reused throughout the notebook
async def run_session(
    runner_instance: Runner,
    user_queries: list[str] | str = None,
    session_name: str = "default",
):
    print(f"\n ### Session: {session_name}")

    # Get app name from the Runner
    app_name = runner_instance.app_name

    # Attempt to create a new session or retrieve an existing one
    try:
        session = await session_service.create_session(
            app_name=app_name, user_id=USER_ID, session_id=session_name
        )
    except:
        session = await session_service.get_session(
            app_name=app_name, user_id=USER_ID, session_id=session_name
        )

    # Process queries if provided
    if user_queries:
        # Convert single query to list for uniform processing
        if type(user_queries) == str:
            user_queries = [user_queries]

        # Process each query in the list sequentially
        for query in user_queries:
            print(f"\nUser > {query}")

            # Convert the query string to the ADK Content format
            query = types.Content(role="user", parts=[types.Part(text=query)])

            # Stream the agent's response asynchronously
            async for event in runner_instance.run_async(
                user_id=USER_ID, session_id=session.id, new_message=query
            ):
                # Check if the event contains valid content
                if event.content and event.content.parts:
                    # Filter out empty or "None" responses before printing
                    if (
                        event.content.parts[0].text != "None"
                        and event.content.parts[0].text
                    ):
                        print(f"{MODEL_NAME} > ", event.content.parts[0].text)
    else:
        print("No queries!")
```

And we configure retry options, since we're hitting an external tool:

```python
retry_config = types.HttpRetryOptions(
    attempts=5,  # Maximum retry attempts
    exp_base=7,  # Delay multiplier
    initial_delay=1,
    http_status_codes=[429, 500, 503, 504],  # Retry on these HTTP errors
)
```

## Creating a Stateful Agent

Next we'll create a stateful agent using ADK. We'll just manage the session in memory for now, but there are other options:

```python
APP_NAME = "default"  # Application
USER_ID = "default"  # User
SESSION = "default"  # Session

MODEL_NAME = "gemini-2.5-flash-lite"


# Step 1: Create the LLM Agent
root_agent = Agent(
    model=Gemini(model="gemini-2.5-flash-lite", retry_options=retry_config),
    name="text_chat_bot",
    description="A text chatbot",  # Description of the agent's purpose
)

# Step 2: Set up Session Management
# InMemorySessionService stores conversations in RAM (temporary)
session_service = InMemorySessionService()

# Step 3: Create the Runner
runner = Runner(agent=root_agent, app_name=APP_NAME, session_service=session_service)
```

We can then prompt it with a few things:

```python
# Run a conversation with two queries in the same session
# Notice: Both queries are part of the SAME session, so context is maintained
await run_session(
    runner,
    [
        "Hi, I am Sam! What is the capital of United States?",
        "Hello! What is my name?",  # This time, the agent should remember!
    ],
    "stateful-agentic-session",
)
```

And if we want to see if it can remember what we asked earlier, we can:

```python
# Run this cell after restarting the kernel. All this history will be gone...
await run_session(
    runner,
    ["What did I ask you about earlier?", "And remind me, what's my name?"],
    "stateful-agentic-session",
)  # Note, we are using same session name
```

## Creating Persistent Sessions

Using in-memory sessions is fine for prototyping, but it's typically not the best approach for production applications. ADK offers a handful of different `SessionService` implementations depending on a user's needs:

| Service | Use Case | Persistence | Best For |
|---------|----------|-------------|----------|
| **InMemorySessionService** | Development & Testing | ❌ Lost on restart | Quick prototypes |
| **DatabaseSessionService** | Self-managed apps | ✅ Survives restarts | Small to medium apps |
| **Agent Engine Sessions** | Production on GCP | ✅ Fully managed | Enterprise scale |
If we want to create a `DatabaseSessionService` using [[SQLite]], we can set this up as follows:

```python
# Step 1: Create the same agent (notice we use LlmAgent this time)
chatbot_agent = LlmAgent(
    model=Gemini(model="gemini-2.5-flash-lite", retry_options=retry_config),
    name="text_chat_bot",
    description="A text chatbot with persistent memory",
)

# Step 2: Switch to DatabaseSessionService
# SQLite database will be created automatically
db_url = "sqlite:///my_agent_data.db"  # Local SQLite file
session_service = DatabaseSessionService(db_url=db_url)

# Step 3: Create a new runner with persistent storage
runner = Runner(agent=chatbot_agent, app_name=APP_NAME, session_service=session_service)
```

And we can interact with the model again:

```python
await run_session(
    runner,
    ["Hi, I am Sam! What is the capital of the United States?", "Hello! What is my name?"],
    "test-db-session-01",
)
```

If we want to see how the data is stored in the database, we can do that via:

```python
import sqlite3

def check_data_in_db():
    with sqlite3.connect("my_agent_data.db") as connection:
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        result = cursor.execute(
            "select app_name, session_id, author, content from events"
        )
        print([_[0] for _ in result.description])
        for each in result.fetchall():
            print(each)


check_data_in_db()
```

## Context Compaction

ADK also supports compacting context/events stored in the session. This summarizes past events, making the context easier for the agent to work with. Here's how we would implement this:

```python
# Re-define our app with Events Compaction enabled
research_app_compacting = App(
    name="research_app_compacting",
    root_agent=chatbot_agent,
    # This is the new part!
    events_compaction_config=EventsCompactionConfig(
        compaction_interval=3,  # Trigger compaction every 3 invocations
        overlap_size=1,  # Keep 1 previous turn for context
    ),
)

db_url = "sqlite:///my_agent_data.db"  # Local SQLite file
session_service = DatabaseSessionService(db_url=db_url)

# Create a new runner for our upgraded app
research_runner_compacting = Runner(
    app=research_app_compacting, session_service=session_service
)
```
