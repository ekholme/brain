A random assortment of kettlebell complexes I like.

## Achilles
Perform with a fairly heavy KB:
- 5 single arm DL
- 4 single arm swing
- 3 clean
- 3 push press (use a lighter KB here if necessary)

## Devil's Tricycle
Perform with a heavy KB
- 8 swings
- 8 high pulls
- 8 offset squats (4/side)

## Doug
- 5-10 single arm rows
- 5-10 single arm swings
- 5-10 single arm thrusters
- repeat on each side

## Swing-Snatch
- 8 single-arm snatches (each side)
- 12 goblet squats (elevate heels on squat wedge, ideally)
