A random assortment of kettlebell complexes I like.

## Achilles
Perform with a fairly heavy KB:
- 5 single arm DL
- 4 single arm swing
- 3 clean
- 3 push press (use a lighter KB here if necessary)

## Armor Building Complex (ABC)
Perform with double kettlebells
- 2 cleans
- 1 press
- 3 front squats
*Can be extended to 4-2-6 or even 6-3-9*

One way to turn this complex into a workout is to do it as an EMOM. I've been doing 30 min EMOMs, and it's been great. I'm not sure I'd go longer than 30 minutes, though.

## Single Arm ABC
Perform with a single kettlebell
- left arm clean & press
- right arm clean & press
- 2 front squats
- right arm clean & press
- left arm clean & press
- 2 front squats

## Big Bubba Flow
Perform with a single **heavy** kettlebell
- 1 deadlift
- 1 hang row (2h row)
- 1 swing
- 1 goblet squat
*when performing as a workout, do multiple 5-8 rds with ~30sec walk as rest. Also follow up with an equal number of heavy farmer's carries*

## Coyote
Perform with a single KB
- 15 swings
- 5 goblet squats
- 3 pushups

To make this a workout, just do a bunch of rounds.

## Devil's Tricycle
Perform with a heavy KB
- 8 swings
- 8 high pulls
- 8 offset squats (4/side)
*To make a workout, do 5-8 sets. If using a heavier weight, drop to 6 reps/movement*

## Doug
- 5-10 single arm rows
- 5-10 single arm swings
- 5-10 single arm thrusters
- repeat on each side

## Hal
- 6 single arm swings
- 6 single arm cleans
- 6 single arm OHP
- 6 single arm snatch
- switch sides after each movement (i.e. performs swings on right, swings on left, cleans on right, cleans on left, etc)

*To make this a workout, do a descending ladder 6-5-4-3-2-1, then ascend back to 6 reps*
## Orin
*do this with a single heavy KB*
- clean & press (RH)
- 2 front-rack lunges (RH)
- clean & press (LH)
- 2 front-rack lunges (LH)
*to make this a full workout, do AMRAP style with rest as needed*
