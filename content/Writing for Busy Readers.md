[Writing for Busy Readers](https://writingforbusyreaders.com/) is a book about exactly what it sounds like -- writing for people who don't have a lot of time to read whatever it is you're sending them. I would 100% recommend it to anyone with a job that involves even a teeny bit of writing.

The whole book is worth reading, but I wanted to post a link to their 1-pager [cheat sheet](https://writingforbusyreaders.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Writing-for-Busy-Readers-Checklist.pdf) here where I can more easily find it.

The six principles in the cheat sheet are:

1. Less is More
2. Make Reading Easy
3. Design for Easy Navigation
4. Use Enough Formatting but No More
5. Tell Readers Why They Should Care
6. Make Responding Easy

It's still worth clicking on the cheat sheet, since it provides some tangible details about what each of these principles looks like in practice.
