[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is a "scientific and technical publishing system" that lets you weave together plain text markdown and executable code in a single document. It currently supports:

- [[R]]
- [[Python]]
- [[Julia]]

Quarto can be used to create websites, books, articles, presentations, and more. It can be rendered into HTML, PDF, and other output formats.

My [personal website](https://ericekholm.com/) ([GH](https://github.com/ekholme/ee-quarto-site)) is built using Quarto.
