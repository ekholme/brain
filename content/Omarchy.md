[Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/) is an opinionated [[Arch Linux]] operating system created by DHH. It's essentially Arch Linux with a suite of software installed and pre-made config files.

It uses Hyprland as its tiling window manager.

Omarchy prioritizes aesthetics, keyboard-driven computer use, and developer productivity. Omarchy makes installing and updating packages easy and more accessible than in other Arch-based system. One feature of Omarchy is that the stable release of Omarchy's package manager delays package releases by about 1 month, which gives helps mitigate the number of breaking changes.
