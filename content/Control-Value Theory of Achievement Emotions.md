The control-value theory (CVT) of achievement emotions describes achievement emotions in terms of appraisals of control and value as antecedents of emotions.

CVT defines achievement emotions as related to either:
1. Achievement outcomes, or
2. Achievement activities

As a result, we can distinguish between two types of emotions:
1. Outcome emotions, and
2. Activity emotions

This is referred to as the *object focus*. Temporal relations to the object focus are also important to CVT. The object of an emotion can be in the present, future, or past.

In the context of achievement emotions, there are typically 3 combinations of *object focus* and *temporal context* we're most concerned with:
1. concurrent activity emotions (e.g. enjoyment or boredom during learning);
2. prospective outcome emotions (e.g. hope and anxiety);
3. retrospective outcome emotions (e.g. pride and shame)

Achievement emotions can also be grouped according to valence (negative to positive) and arousal/activation (deactivating to activating).

## Appraisal Antecedents

Links between control-value appraisals and achievement emotions are at the core of CVT. Achievement emotions depend on the interplay of perceived control and perceived value of the object.

Activity emotions depend on appraisals of current competence (control) as well as the perceived value of the activity. Appraisals of high competence and high value lead to enjoyment (and also promote motivation). In contrast, appraisals of low competence and high value can lead to anger. Appraisals of low value (regardless of control appraisals) are thought to lead to boredom.

These same propositions can be applied to retrospective and prospective outcome emotions
