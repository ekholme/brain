## Ingredients
- 500g bread flour
- 350g lukewarm water (70%)
- 100g starter (20%)
- 10g salt

## Process
This assumes I'm baking on a weekday and need to work around my work schedule, but the principle still holds

### Morning 1 (before work)
- Remove starter from fridge and feed

### Afternoon/Evening 1 (after work)
- Make shaggy dough by loosely mixing flour, water, and starter together in large glass bowl
- Fermentolyse for 30 minutes -- cover and let dough rest on counter for ~30 mins
- Gently mix in salt. Knead for a few minutes.
- Transfer to lightly oiled (or floured) 2 quart plastic tub
- For next ~5 hours, bulk ferment in tub. For the first ~2-3 hours, stretch and fold every 30 mins to build dough strength. Keep lid on tub when not actively working it
- Preshape dough and let sit on counter for ~20-30 mins
- Shape and transfer to a lightly floured banneton.
- Cold proof in fridge until ready to bake. Usually this is the next afternoon for me, but it can be kept in the fridge for up to 3 days
### Afternoon/Evening 2 (after work)
- Preheat oven with dutch oven inside at 450 for at least 30 mins
- Just before baking, remove banneton from fridge.
- Gently shape into a boule (if it doesn't come out of banneton well-shaped)
- Spray shaped dough with lukewarm water
- Score dough
- Put dough on baking sling, and place baking sling in the hot dutch oven
- Bake covered for 30 mins
- Remove lid from dutch oven and bake for another 20 mins
- Let cool on wire rack for at least 1 hour
