## Ingredients

- 360g King Arthur bread flour
- 220g warm water (can use anywhere from 200-240g)
- 200g liquid perferment
- 1 egg yolk
- 13g sugar
- 15g salt
- 1 stick frozen butter

## Steps
*This recipe will follow the same general flow as the [[Basic Sourdough Bread Recipe]], with some modifications*

- **Make the Liquid Preferment:** this is just 90g flour, 90g water, 20g starter allowed to rise for ~8-12 hours. In my case, this is the same ratio I use for my starter, so I can just use ripe starter
- Combine all ingredients except the butter in a bowl and mix until fully combined. Transfer to a lightly greased dough bucket and let rise for 20 mins
- Perform 2-3 sets of bowl folds, separated by 20 mins
- Spread the dough onto a wet countertop so it forms approx a 5 x 14 rectangle
- Grate 2/3rds of the butter onto the dough and perform a letter fold
- Grate the remaining butter onto the dough and roll up into a log
- Place dough back in bucket and let rest for 30 mins
- Perform 2 coil folds, separated by 30 mins
- Allow dough to rise for 2-4 hours (likely will not be doubled in size)
- Shape the dough into a batard and place into a banneton. *We don't need to preshape.*
- Cover banneton and leave in fridge for 12+ hours
- Bake in the typical fashion (preheat oven to 450 w/dutch oven, score dough, bake in dutch oven with lid on for 25 mins, remove lid and bake for another 20+ mins)
