Sourdough bread uses a sourdough starter, which contains wild yeast and bacteria, to leaven the dough rather than using commercial yeast. This is what gives sourdough its chewiness and its tangy flavor.

## Steps in Making Sourdough

Assuming we already have a ripe (fed) starter, the general steps for making a "pure" sourdough bread are as follows:
1. **Mix Ingredients to Make the Dough**: these ingredients will simply be flour, water, and starter
2. **Knead Dough**: knead the dough for a few minutes until it's smooth
3. **Bulk Ferment/Stretch and Fold**: Put the dough into a container with a lid to allow it to ferment. Every so often, stretch and fold the dough. This will build dough strength
4. **Shape the Dough**: remove the dough from the container and shape it into whatever shape you want it to be.
5. **Proof the Dough**: after the dough is shaped, allow it to rise. This might take place in a banneton basket, on a baking sheet, or in some other container. The shaped dough should be covered to prevent it from drying out. This proof can take place on the counter (for 1-2 hours) or in the fridge (overnight)
6. **Preheat the Oven**: about 30 minutes before baking, preheat the oven and set up for baking. This might include allowing a dutch oven or baking stone to head up in the oven.
7. **Score the Bread**: with a razor blade, score the bread. This helps control the expansion during baking.
8. **Bake**: Bake the bread! This is probably around ~450F and anywhere from 25 minutes to 50 minutes. If using steam, remove the steam source (e.g. take the lid off the dutch oven) after ~30 minutes.
9. **Let Cool**: remove from the oven and allow the bread to cool for about an hour before slicing.
