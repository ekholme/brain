Sourdough bread uses a sourdough starter, which contains wild yeast and bacteria, to leaven the dough rather than using commercial yeast. This is what gives sourdough its chewiness and its tangy flavor.

## Steps in Making Sourdough

Assuming we already have a ripe (fed) starter, the general steps for making a "pure" sourdough bread are as follows:
1. **Autolyse**: Mix the flour and water together until they're fully incorporated. Let sit for 30-60 minutes
2. **Add Starter & Salt, Then Knead Dough**: Add the starter and salt to the flour/water mixture. Knead in the bowl for 5-10 minutes, at minimum until everything is fully incorporated
3. **Bulk Ferment/Stretch and Fold**: Put the dough into a container with a lid to allow it to ferment. For the first 2 hours, stretch and fold the dough every 30 minutes. This will build dough strength. If the dough needs it, do additional stretch & folds. Allow the dough to bulk ferment on the counter until it's increased by at least 50%.
4. **Preshape the Dough**: Once the dough is ready, remove it from the container. If making multiple loaves, divide the dough. Shape each piece into a ball, then cover and allow to rest on the counter for about 30 minutes.
5. **Shape the Dough**: Do the final shaping. Shape the dough into a boule or batard, then place into a banneton.
6. **Proof the Dough**:  Proof the dough either on the counter (for 1-2 hours) or in the fridge (12-24 hours). Regardless of where it's proofed, the dough should be covered to prevent it from drying out. 
7. **Preheat the Oven**: about 30 minutes before baking, preheat the oven and set up for baking. This might include allowing a dutch oven or baking stone to head up in the oven.
8. **Score the Bread**: with a razor blade, score the bread. This helps control the expansion during baking.
9. **Bake**: Bake the bread! This is probably around ~450F and anywhere from 25 minutes to 50 minutes. If using steam, remove the steam source (e.g. take the lid off the dutch oven) after ~25 minutes.
10. **Let Cool**: remove from the oven and allow the bread to cool for about an hour before slicing.
