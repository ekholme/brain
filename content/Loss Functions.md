A [loss function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_function) is a mathematical function that quantifies the "cost" or "error" associated with some set of values. In a machine learning context, a loss function generally provides an indication of the amount of error in a model's predicted outputs. We tend to train machine learning models by using some sort of optimization algorithm to minimize a loss function.

Some examples of loss functions include:
- [[Binary Cross Entropy]] for binary outcomes
