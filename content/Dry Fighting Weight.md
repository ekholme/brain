[Dry Fighting Weight](https://www.strongfirst.com/dry-fighting-weight/) (DFW) is a fairly minimalistic kettlebell program centered around 2 exercises:

1. Clean & Press
2. Front Squat

Each session in a workout is 30 minutes (not including warmup), and the goal is to do as many reps as possible *without blowing yourself up*. It shouldn't feel like a Crossfit-style metcon.

You can use a single kb or double kbs, as appropriate. But double kbs is probably better.

DFW is a 4-week program structured like so:

**Week #1:**

- Day 1: Ladders. 1, 2, 3
- Day 2: Sets of 1
- Day 3: Sets of 2

**Week #2:**

- Day 1: Ladders. 1, 2, 3
- Day 2: Sets of 1
- Day 3: Sets of 3

**Week #3:**

- Day 1: Ladders. 1, 2, 3, 4
- Day 2: Sets of 2
- Day 3: Sets of 3

**Week #4:**

- Day 1: Ladders. 1, 2, 3, 4, (5)
- Day 2: Sets of 2
- Day 3: Alternate between sets of 3 and 4 if possible.

**Week #5:**

- Day 1: Perform 3Ã—3.
- Day 2: Perform a new RM with the same kettlebell(s) you used for the previous 4 weeks. Or you may go up to a heavier kettlebell(s) and perform a new RM.
