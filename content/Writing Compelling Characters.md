Ideas from Brandon Sanderson's lecture on [writing compelling characters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-6z7JqvDoE&list=PLSH_xM-KC3ZvzkfVo_Dls0B5GiE2oMcLY&index=6).

According to Sanderson, there are 3 features of compelling characters:

- Proactivity
- Relatability
- Capability

However, not every character needs to have *all of these features.* Brandon's rule of thumb is to have 1 feature where they're strong, 1 where they're weak, and another where they're growing.

## Proactivity

People tend to want to read stories with proactive characters...because they're the ones that do stuff.
