Supervised learning is a statistical framework in which we use training data comprising *predictors* (independent variables, features, **X**) and an *outcome* (dependent variable, target, **y**) to train a model that can predict **y** given some **X**. In other words, we are trying to learn the patterns of **X** that relate to **y**.

This contrasts unsupervised learning, where there is no outcome we are trying to predict, and we're instead concerned with discovering patterns in how various features of **X** relate to one another.
