## Ingredients
- 500g bread flour
- 350g lukewarm water (70%)
- 100g starter (20%)
- 10g salt
- 12g ground cinnamon
- 120g raisins

## Process

Follow the same general process for the [[Basic Sourdough Boule Recipe]], except with the following tweaks:

1. Just before starting to mix the dough, put the raisins in a bowl of water. This will hydrate them slightly and ensure they don't absorb too much water from the dough itself. This hydration process should last for at least 30 mins.
2. After the fermentolyse phase and the salt is added, spread the dough out into a large rectangle on a flat surface.
3. Coat the top of the rectangle in a layer of cinnamon and an even-ish layer of raisins, then fold over a few times and shape into another large rectangle. Repeat the layering of cinnamon/raisins and subsequent folding until you've used all of your cinnamon and raisins.
4. From this point, follow the basic sourdough boule recipe.

## Possible Tweaks

The first time I made this, the dough felt a bit dryer than I wanted when it started to bake. I might want to increase the water to 375g (75% hydration).

It also might be interesting to add a little bit of sugar to the dough, although I'm not quite sure how much it would need.
